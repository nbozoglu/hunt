# Description

We observed some odd network traffic, and found this file on our web server... can you find the strange domains that our systems are reaching out to?

NOTE, this challenge is based off of a real malware sample. We have done our best to "defang" the code, but out of abudance of caution it is strongly encouraged you only analyze this inside of a virtual environment separate from any production devices.
